TFS Custom Text

This plugin is used for the front-page.php file. It produces a non-techy dashboard interface called a 'widget', where all one has to do is enter text and click save. The plugin or widget is associated wirh the 'TFS Imaage Widget' but does not depend on that widget.

Feel free to test this widget in other widget areas but don't be surprised if it doesn't work the way you want. 

The best all around text widget is the simple 'Text' widget.
